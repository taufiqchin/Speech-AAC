- Users who have difficulty speaking or expressing themselves can use icons, text, and voice output to communicate effectively.

**2. Educational tool for learning language and sentences**  
- Schools or teachers can use the app to teach sentence formation, vocabulary, and language structure in a fun, visual way.  
- Even students without communication difficulties can benefit from visual learning and language practice.
